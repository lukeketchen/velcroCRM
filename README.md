# VelcroCRM


Making a crm that will be open for anyone to install. 


### Watch this space!


## Research
My first thoughts of what is needed:

- cold leads
    - dates
    - contact details
    - notes on how, who

- hot leads
    - same as cold leads
    - potential spending / earnings from job

- customers
    - all items passed up from the cold & hot details
    - job / app names


Somewhere to track the communication with potential clients that might turn into work.

An old school contact book.
